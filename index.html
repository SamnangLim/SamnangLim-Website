        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychologyüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I still remember the days where I dreamt about a wealthy and happy family that I coincided in- but like any dream, it wasn‚Äôt true. Money has always been a problem in my household, it was even a problem before we had a household. I was born in Cambodia, one of the world‚Äôs poorest countries. I was raised by a loving family that was still recovering from the Cambodian genocide of 1975. I arrived in the United States at the age of four, alongside my older brother and hardworking mother. We bounced houses, living with my extended family that always looked down on us as ‚Äúthe dirty ones‚Äù.  My parents had split before I came to the United States, leaving my single mother with the responsibility of raising both my brother and I. I know many say that money doesn‚Äôt bring you happiness, but I was sure happy when we had it<br><br>

        I‚Äôm not perfect. I believe that I possess no traits of a perfect person. Quite honestly, I find myself a horrible human being-  I‚Äôm manipulative, selfish and greedy. I constantly find myself at war, facing something I cannot defeat. This enemy is strong and it has no physical form.  Its bullets hit fast like emotions traveling far and wide, leaving its first victim in pain and agony. Its named is Depression and has been fighting against me for years. Throughout this war, I have become broken, damaged and have learned what it is like to be on the edge of death. It guns me down every time I find love and happiness, depleting me of it. Despite the number of times I have accepted my fate in this war, I find myself still alive. In fact, I‚Äôm getting stronger every time we meet on the battlefield.
<br><br>

       Everyday with depression was a cloudy day but I failed to see that it was me that blocked out the sun. It was me that made me upset over that test, that breakup, that argument. With the ending of long friendships, came new ones. It was not about who had stuck around, it was about who has helped me get to this present moment. I was lost, bewildered by my own identity. I was searching for answers to my depression, when in reality I should have been uncovering the attributes of my soul. What makes me stand out as a candidate is not that I have persevered through depression, because I know I‚Äôm not alone --It is that I believe depression makes me who I am today. I would have never gotten here without it, I wouldn‚Äôt be me without it. 
 	I can look at myself today and know that I have grown, but it doesn‚Äôt stop here. This stage in my life has only been a stepping stone in my pursuit of happiness.
